# PD2-Weapon-Stat-Randomizer

The core codebase for the **Payday 2 Weapon Stat Randomizer**, now rewritten in modern C++ for performance, maintainability, and developer fun.

## About

This mod was born from the chaotic energy of two friends who’ve played *way too much* Payday 2 and needed to shake things up. We’re not here to balance — we’re here to **break** (strategically).

This C++ rewrite isn't intended for public distribution. There’s no formal support, no guarantees, and if it breaks — we hope you know how to compile things. That said, suggestions and PRs are more than welcome.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Payday 2 (installed via Steam)
- A Lua mod manager (like SuperBLT)
- Windows system with a modern C++ toolchain (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)

### Installation & Usage

1. Download the latest release `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/nunokingler/PD2-Weapon-Stat-Randomizer/releases).
2. Run it — it will generate a modified Lua stat file based on the current weapon list and your RNG fate.
3. Drop the generated `.lua` file into your Payday 2 mod's appropriate folder.
4. Boot the game and suffer the consequences.

## Contributing

Contributions are what keep chaos fresh. Want to tweak the balancer? Add support for new stat curves? Randomize fire modes? Go for it.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/MyWildIdea`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add wild idea"`)
4. Push (`git push origin feature/MyWildIdea`)
5. Open a pull request — and maybe a bottle of whiskey
